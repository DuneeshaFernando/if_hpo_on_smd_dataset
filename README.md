This repo is used to keep code that hyperparameter tunes the other training approaches of the SMD dataset (apart from AE model training). Mainly IFAD approach.
Here we have the codes to evaluate training of IF with and without anomaly data.
Training each machine separately - This is used to evaluate the different ML approaches as well
